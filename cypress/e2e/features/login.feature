Feature: Login page

    As a tester, I want to test the "https://admin-demo.nopcommerce.com/" application login page

    Background:
        Given I am on the login page

    Scenario: Checking the visibility of heading and subheading on the page
       Then I should see "Admin area demo" heading on the page
       And I should see "Welcome, please sign in!" heading on the page

    # Scenario Outline: Check user is able to successfully log in to Dashboard application with the valid credentials
    #     When I fill "<email>" on the "email" input field
    #     And I fill "<password>" on the "password" input field
    #     And I check the "remember me" checkbox
    #     And I click on the "Log in" button
    #     Then I should navigate to the "admin" dashboard page

    #     Examples:
    #         | email       | password       |
    #         | admin_email | admin_password |


    # Scenario Outline: Check user is not able to log in to Dashboard application with the invalid credentials
    #     When I fill "<email>" on the "email" input field
    #     And I fill "<password>" on the "password" input field
    #     And I check the "remember me" checkbox
    #     And I click on the "Log in" button
    #     Then I should see "<message>" message on the page

    #     Examples:
    #         | email         | password         | message                                                          |
    #         | invalid_email | invalid_password | Login was unsuccessful. Please correct the errors and try again. |
